 allocation of virtio devices. Dynamic allocations will also be made possible
 using the rpmsg bus (similar to how we already do dynamic allocations of

+8. System Resource Manager (SRM)
+
+Since some resources are shared (directly or not) between the processors, a
+processor cannot manage such resources without potentially impacting the other
+processors : as an example, if a processor changes the frequency of a clock, the
+frequency of another clock managed by another processor may be updated too.
+
+The System Resource Manager prevents such resource conflicts between the
+processors : it reserves and initializes the system resources of the peripherals
+assigned to a remote processor.
+
+As of today the following resources are controlled by the SRM:
+- clocks
+- regulators (power supplies)
+
+The SRM is implemented as an 'rproc_subdev' and registered to remoteproc_core.
+Unlike the virtio device (vdev), the SRM subdev is probed *before* the rproc
+boots, ensuring the availability of the resources before the remoteproc starts.
+
+The resources handled by the SRM are defined in the DeviceTree: please read
+Documentation/devicetree/bindings/remoteproc/rproc-srm.txt for details.
